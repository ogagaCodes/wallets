============================
Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
For example, the square matrix array is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9 
The left-to-right diagonal = 1+5+9 = 15. The right to left diagonal = 3+5+9 = 17. Their absolute difference is .|15-17| = 2.

Function description
The function should be called ‘diagonalDifference’  and should takes the following parameter:
int arr[n][m]: an array of integers

Returns
int: the absolute diagonal difference

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer,n, the number of rows and columns in the square matrix .
Each of the next n lines describes a row,array[i] , and consists of n space-separated integers array[i][j].

Output Format
Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.
